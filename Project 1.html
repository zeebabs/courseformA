        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</p>

        <p>This week i am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks,</i> Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching." </p>

        <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>

        <p>Location:<br>
            Baker's Corner, Seekonk,MA.

        <p>Hours:<br>
